You can access the webpage by going to https://jasmiina.github.io/

It's a small webpage that shows photos in a slideshow, and when you click on a picture, it tells you where the photo was taken at.

(I made this cause I always get beautiful scenery pictures on my Windows 10 lock screen but it doesn't tell me where they were taken at, I needed something to soothe my pain lol)
